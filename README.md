simple blog poster uses a restAPI built in express to handle routing to a mongo database.

use 'npm run start-dev' to run the mongo daemon, express server, and react development server via foreman

the text editor is quill and its integrated with react using react-quill. I've disabled images for the time being because of POST issues
